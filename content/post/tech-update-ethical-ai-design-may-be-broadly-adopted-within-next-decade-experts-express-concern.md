Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now being adopted for automation in various sectors — from diagnosing medical conditions to regulating traffic and help drive vehicles. It is also used for running chatbots for customers to spotting signs of fraud in financial transactions. This new technology is also being adopted to read people's emotions and to “speak” to them as voice assistants. A majority of experts, however, are not sure whether AI should be so widely adopted without proper and adequate safeguards. They have expressed their concerns while talking to Pew Research.

The concerns most experts raised were how advances in [AI](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/tags/artificial-intelligence) will affect humans, their free will, and what it would mean to be productive in that age. Another worry was that the evolution of AI by 2030 may continue to be focussed on optimising profits and social control, with stakeholders struggling to reach a consensus on ethics.

However, they had some hope of finding ways to address these issues as there's a global focus on ethical AI and this is moving society towards an agreement to make AI development beneficial, autonomous and just.
