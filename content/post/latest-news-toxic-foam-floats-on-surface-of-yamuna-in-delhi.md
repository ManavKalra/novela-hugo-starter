A layer of toxic foam was seen floating on the surface of the Yamuna river at Kalindi Kunj in Delhi on Wednesday morning. Before this, the toxic foam was seen floating over the river on April 6 and 20. At that time, the environmentalists had said that the frothing could be because of the release of certain gases when reacting with few specific bacteria. The foam at the Yamuna river made global headlines in 2019 when the devotees of Chhat puja were seen standing in waist-deep toxic forth in the Yamuna at Kalindi Kunj.  When inquired about the incident, experts said that the formation of forth was a common thing in the Yamuna but has increased in the last five to six years.  The Delhi government chalked out a nine-point action plan earlier this year to reduce frothing in the Yamuna river, which is happening due to the discharge of untreated sewage in the river.
